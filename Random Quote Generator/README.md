on the browsder when a button is pressed. The details of the code is described briefly below: 

html file was pre written to have a green backgound, a quote, and a button to change the 
quote displayed on the brower once proper script is written

script file contains two functions that are used to get a new quote printed out on the browser

    Gets a random quote from within the pre written quote array within the scipt file
    and returns it

printQuote

    browser to then display the contents of each quote object accordingly.
